			var commentsList = [{"user":"lsal mom","content":"This is almost too cute for words! I bought this for my 5 year old as a Christmas gift when she requested \"bad guy stuff\". After a lot of questioning we figured out she wanted to handcuff and ticket bad guys and I began to look for a police officer outfit. She is 48\" tall and wears a size 7/8. She is really slim but this entire outfit is such a good fit on her and she still has another year or two she will be able to wear it. It is not so big it looks sloppy and the blue is so bright and beautiful. The hat fits her really good and she has a big head. I like that it is gender neutral because she has a 4 year old brother that might like to play with it someday. She carries her own dry erase marker with her ticket so she can mark and erase the offense. She really loves the whistle and laughs like crazy when she handcuffs her big sisters. I also like that it did not come with a gun. If you want your child to have one with their costume that could be a separate purchase but since we try to teach gun safety I like not having one she can play with and maybe become a little too accustomed to seeing and using.","purchase_model":"Product Packaging: Standard Packaging   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2015-12-31 10:52:07"},{"user":"R. L. Bonk","content":"Bought this for my 46\", 58lb 7yr old daughter for Christmas because she wanted a police dress up set SO badly! It fit her perfectly & she has been wearing it almost daily since when she's not at school. Definitely worth it. The walkie talkie is a bit cheap.. but the fake \"ticket\" is compatible with dry erase markers for use over & over & the officer identification card looks awesome with a small photo of her & her name on it. That is also good for dry erase, but she wanted her name on it in permanent marker because she said she's the only officer using that outfit! haha Brought a huge smile to her face Christmas morning & many days since!","purchase_model":"Product Packaging: Standard Packaging   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2015-02-04 10:52:07"},{"user":"MAJ214","content":"I'm a grandma who purchased this set for my 3 3/4 year old grandson who is big into being a policeman and \"arresting\" whoever he can. This is one of the best designed and constructed costumes I have ever seen. Pockets in the front allow the child to carry the radio (sounds like a real police radio w/static!), whistle, handcuffs, etc. The hat has a badge that can be worn on the hat or attached to the chest pocket. There is even an identification card that can be completed and a photo attached. Also comes with a \"ticket\" which I made copies of so he could hand these out.Alex is big for his age and I would guess that the costume is a size 5.Perfect for him now to wear over a shirt or sweater. under. He can easily wear it into next year. This costume is way more than expected for the price. So good, in fact, that I'm going to order the physician costume for Alex!","purchase_model":"Product Packaging: Standard Packaging   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-01-01 10:52:07"},{"user":"Courtney B.","content":"My son loves this police officer costume set.He's 4, and his father is training to become a police officer.This role play set allows him to mimic his dad, which he of course loves to do.My only warning is to be careful of the whistle - it falls out of the elastic band meant to hold it very easily.I'd suggest putting it in one of the clear pockets, or else tying a string to it so it doesn't get lost (as ours did, in the middle of Best Buy.Good thing we found it!).The walkie talkie does make sounds, but it's one repetitive clip that can get old very fast - so it wouldn't hurt to keep the batteries out if that sort of thing bugs you.Overall a great set that my son wants to wear everywhere!This set fits my son perfectly - at 4, he's about 44\" tall and 45 lbs.","purchase_model":"Product Packaging: Standard Packaging   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-04-02 10:52:07"},{"user":"Kate","content":"I wanted to buy my 3 yr old who loves to dress up something other than tutu's and princess dresses so I went with this policeman costume.I know others have complained about the buttons falling off and I do expect that will happen with time however my experience with costumes and dress up clothes is that they're often made cheaply and flimsy which I do not find this one.The jacket material is thicker than any other dress up clothes that I have seen.I think the quality is wonderful when comparing it to other dress up clothes.I also think it'll help teach my daughter that girls can be more than just pretty princesses.She'll love it.I can't wait to give it to her for her birthday.Every day is dress up day in our house so I am sure it'll get a lot of use!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2010-07-27 10:52:07"},{"user":"B\u00echeo","content":"I got this for my 4years old son for his Halloween dress up. He loves to play pretend and wish to be a police officer. This costume is very nice material and come with a lot of accessories. I always love this brand because of their quality material costume. It runs a little big for my boy, but I guess he can wear it again next year. One minor thing is I wish they have a place to put the handcuffs and the whistle rather than having the boy to hold it.","purchase_model":"Product Packaging: Standard Packaging   Reviews","score":"4.0","date":"2020-04-23 10:52:07"},{"user":"AKHunter","content":"Great set!

My nephew is in the phase of loving everything little boys usually love..monster trucks, muscle car toys, Nintendo D.S., all of which he got for Christmas.With that being said, we purposely had this as one of his last gifts to open knowing he would be overwhelmed (he's 4) and preoccupied by other gifts he received though out the day.I can't even explain how EXCITED he was when he saw it.He had to put it RIGHT ON and he wore it the rest of the evening, even wore it for the car ride home :)Great gift and great memories.I would highly recommend it for the little ones who still have a great imagination!","purchase_model":"Product Packaging: Standard Packaging   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2013-01-19 10:52:07"},{"user":"Desiree Porto","content":"My son loves pretending to be a police officer and ticket or arrest people. He doesn't like to wear full costumes. So this was good for him, its just a jacket and a hat basically. He loves it and wants to wear it all the time. He doesn't use the walkie talkie much though. Its kind of cheap honestly, can barely hear the little sound that it does make. But we have our own walkie talkie set, so no biggie. Everything else is great. He actually likes the plastic handcuffs better than the metal ones we also have. Will be purchasing more of M&D costumes for our pretend play. :-)","purchase_model":"Product Packaging: Standard Packaging   Reviews","score":"4.0","date":"2020-06-03 10:52:07"},{"user":"Rebecca","content":"This is my preschooler's second Melissa and Doug costume (he also has the fire fighter set). This is very high quality. He loves the walkie talkie that comes with it. My only complaint is the whistle they include. Not many parents want their kids blowing a whistle around the house. It also seemed a little small, making me worried about choking hazard (we ended up hiding it, because we also have a 17 month old and I really don't want her to have it for safety reasons, but also I don't want them both mouthing it and sharing germs). Perhaps a better accessory would have been a holder or pad to go along with the ticket (which my son loves to give out, by the way). Overall a great item that encourages role play with kids.","purchase_model":"Product Packaging: Standard Packaging   Reviews","score":"4.0","date":"2012-01-12 10:52:07"}];
